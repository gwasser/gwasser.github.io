[SEI Podcast: Understanding Vulnerability Analysis in the Rust Programming Language](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/library/understanding-vulnerability-analysis-in-the-rust-programming-language/)

I co-authored the above article and podcast with David Svoboda. Joe Sible provided some review and feedback.
