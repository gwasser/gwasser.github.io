Below is a round up of a series of blog posts I authored for the Software Engineering Institute blog describing the coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) process and challenges in coordinating vulnerability responses with vendors.

[SEI Blog Post: CVD Series: Principles of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (Part 2 of 9)](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/cvd-series-principles-of-coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-part-2-of-9/) provides an overview of some important concepts for companies to consider when forming a coordinated vulnerability disclosure response and policy. ([Part 1](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/cvd-series-what-is-coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-part-1-of-9/) only has a brief introduction and list of credits; Parts 3 through 9 do not appear to be published any longer.)

[SEI Blog Post: Reach Out and Mail Someone](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/reach-out-and-mail-someone/) shares some experience with reaching vendors about software vulnerabilities in their products; if a CVD process does not yet exist, email may not reach the right team to address the vulnerability, so I would work through the CERT/CC to send physical mail to vendors to notify them of security issues.

[SEI Blog Post: How To Win Friends and Coordinate A Vulnerability](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/how-win-friends-and-coordinate-vulnerability/) is a short post announcing the creation of the ["VulWiki"](https://vuls.cert.org) as an online repository for both independent security researchers and software vendors to learn more about CVD and how to professionally navigate various challenges in the process. I contributed a good amount of the initial content available on the VulWiki.
