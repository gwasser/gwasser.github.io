2016 Emerging Technology Domains Risk Survey

By Christopher King, Dan J. Klinedinst, Todd Lewellen, and Garret Wassermann
This 2016 report provides a snapshot of our current understanding of future technologies. 

Full Abstract:
In today’s increasingly interconnected world, the information security community must be prepared to address emerging vulnerabilities that may arise from new technology domains. Understanding trends and emerging technologies can help information security professionals, leaders of organizations, and others interested in information security to anticipate and prepare for such vulnerabilities. This report, originally prepared in 2015 for the Department of Homeland Security United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), provides a snapshot of the current understanding of future technologies.
