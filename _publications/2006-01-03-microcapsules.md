excerpt: 'Herein we report the use of silicon membranes in the fabrication of micrometer-sized square tubes and capsules. The Si pores of a membrane are modified with a polymer component such that a gap is created along the wall of the channel. Electrochemical deposition within this modified structure creates square metal tubes. The tubes can be released from the membrane, or with further processing, be converted to buoyant microcapsules with interesting assembly properties.'

Materials science research performed as an advanced undergraduate student during the Advanced Materials Research Institute (AMRI) 2005 Summer Internship. The work included both some experimental research testing samples and some computer modeling of the physics. I would later go on to work with AMRI researchers on a masters' project during graduate school for my M.S. in Physics.

Abstract:

    Template methods have been extensively investigated for
    the preparation of a number of one-dimensional (1D) nano-
    structures, including chemical sensors, high-density data stor-
    age, and microdevices.[1–11] Alumina and polymer membranes
    with channel diameters ranging from tens of nanometers to
    several micrometers are commonly used in these methods,
    leading to various wire and tube structures by both chemical
    and electrochemical routes.[6–8,12–15] In addition, porous silicon
    membranes have been prepared with features in the hundreds
    of nanometers to micrometer range.[16,17] As with some alumi-
    na membranes,[18] silicon membranes can be formed with non-
    circular channels.[17] While Si membranes have been exten-
    sively studied as photonic crystals,[19–21] their use as templates
    has been relatively limited.[22–26] Herein we report the use of
    silicon membranes in the fabrication of micrometer-sized
    square tubes and capsules. The Si pores of a membrane are
    modified with a polymer component such that a gap is created
    along the wall of the channel. Electrochemical deposition
    within this modified structure creates square metal tubes. The
    tubes can be released from the membrane, or with further
    processing, be converted to buoyant microcapsules with inter-
    esting assembly properties.
