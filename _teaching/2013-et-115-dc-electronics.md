An introduction to electric circuits, covering basics like Ohm's Law, series and parallel circuits, and basic circuit analysis. Included a lab component where students put together simple circuits using resistors and other components and learned to properly use equipment like voltmeters.

The short description from the syllabus:

    A study of electronic laws and components in DC circuits, emphasizing the study and
    application of network theorems interrelating voltage, current and resistance. Students
    apply practical mathematics as it supports understanding the principles of electronics.
    A laboratory provides practical experience using both physical components and
    computer-generated simulations.
