An introductory algebra-based general physics course, covering key concepts of classical mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and modern physics (quantum mechanics).

The course was geared toward electronics and software engineering students that needed a general background in science concepts and problem solving skills. I supplemented the course to tie together especially concepts of electromagnetism and atoms (quantum mechanics) to better understand the theory behind electricity and electronics including computers.

The short description from the syllabus:

    Students in this course study the concepts of general physics.
    Practical applications demonstrate the theory.
