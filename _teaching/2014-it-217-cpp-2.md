A second introductory course on programming using the C++ language. We covered additional data structures like linked lists, pointers, basic sorting algorithms, templates and the STL, and handling file I/O with proper exception handling.

This was the second course in the software applications programming track.

The short course description from the syllabus:

    This course is a continuation of the preceding C++ course. Students will examine
    concepts of classes, dynamic memory allocation, exception handling, file input/output,
    and the STL. Basic object-oriented programming will be presented.
