Mathematics III, an overview of basic differential and integral calculus.
The course was meant mostly for students in the software/programming track, and so focused a little more on applications to computer science, for example, by introducing concepts like "Big-O" notation for algorithms in the context of limits.

From syllabus:

    Upon successful completion of this course, the student should be able to:
    1. Differentiate algebraic and transcendental functions using the basic derivative rules.
    2. Integrate algebraic and transcendental functions using the basic integration rules.
    3. Solve application problems involving derivatives.
    4. Solve application problems involving integrals
