General Physics 1, algebra-based.
General physics course for science majors outside of physics and engineering (biology, etc.).

From syllabus:

    This course covers basic knowledge of classical mechanics, fluids, and thermodynamics. This corresponds to
    most of the material in the first fifteen chapters of Cutnell and Johnson: kinematics in one and two
    dimensions, vectors, dynamics with Newton's laws of motion, rotations, concepts of work and energy,
    equilibrium, elasticity, oscillations, orbits, fluid mechanics, heat capacity, kinetic theory of gases, heat
    engines, and the laws of thermodynamics.

Taught the lecture course alongside the laboratory course, PHYS 1033. Which I also co-wrote the lab manual for (see my Publications list for more information).
